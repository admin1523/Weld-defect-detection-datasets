# Weld-defect-detection-datasets
📌 Dataset Overview

This repository provides two weld radiographic film digital image datasets designed for weld defect detection and analysis.
The datasets are collected from real industrial radiographic inspection scenarios and contain various typical welding defects, making them suitable for:

Weld defect detection

Image processing and computer vision research

Machine learning / deep learning–based defect classification and localization

Industrial nondestructive testing (NDT) applications

Both datasets consist of digital radiographic images of weld seams, with clear defect characteristics and practical imaging challenges such as noise, low contrast, and complex backgrounds.

🔍 Defect Types

The datasets include common weld defects observable in radiographic films, such as (but not limited to):

Lack of penetration

Porosity

Slag inclusion

Cracks

Incomplete fusion

Other typical weld anomalies

⚠️ Note: The exact defect categories and annotation formats (if applicable) should be interpreted according to the specific experimental setup used by the researcher.
